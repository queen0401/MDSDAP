Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 5 to 10% of AML is associated with activating point mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), particularly at the D835 residue. FLT3 D835 mutations are a common mechanism of clinical resistance to type II FLT3 inhibitors (sorafenib, quizartinib and ponatinib), which bind only the inactive kinase conformation. However, gilteritinib, a type I oral inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL, demonstrated preclinical activity against type II FLT3 inhibitor resistance-conferring D835 mutations and clinical activity as monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated AML in multiple clinical trials. The 2017 FDA approved FLT3 mutation companion diagnostic assay can detect a D835 or I836 mutation, but cannot distinguish which of these residues is mutated.

The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic:eid8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic:eid8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic:eid6930]. These pre-clinical and limited clinical studies show that ETV6-NTRK3 fusion-positive B-ALL may demonstrate response to larotrectinib with minimal adverse effects similar to solid tumors for which these are FDA-approved.	39	6930,8917,6099,8931,7993,8930,7496	2023-01-09 21:47:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8917,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6099,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8931,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7496	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

KANK1::NTRK2 has been reported in five published tumors, (CA1), including in 4 brain tumors, with NTRK2 the 3’ partner gene in each case (FG1). Additionally, the fusion junctions reported are predicted to retain an intact NTRK2 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) (FG2) and the TKD to be in-frame (FG3). KANK1 has been reported as a 5’ fusion partner in other kinase gene fusions in cancers (CA2). In two of the five reported cases, KANK1::NTRK2 positive tumors demonstrated response to NTRK targeted (larotrectinib) treatment (CV). Expression of the fusion has been detected by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining (FS2).

NTRK3 ETV6::NTRK3	779	Cancer	162			Oncogenic	Supports	Oncogenic							ETV6::NTRK3 is an oncogenic fusion in multiple cancer types.	ETV6::NTRK3 fusion transcripts include the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3. The fusion has been observed in multiple tumor types including breast secretory carcinoma, congenital fibrosarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, and other hematologic and solid tumors. Oncogenicity assessment utilizing ClinGen NTRK SC-VCEP Guidelines yields the following criteria. FG1, FG2, and FG3, since NTRK3 is 3' partner, retains kinase domain, and is in frame (civicEID:10502). The fusion is described in > 100 tumor cases (CA1), ETV6 is found in other cancer associated fusions (civicEID:8599, CA2). ETV6::NTRK3 induces transformation in cells and tumors in mice (civicEID:8931, FS1), expression of ETV6 in tumors is verified (civicEID:10504, FS2), and the fusion responds to therapeutic inhibition (civicAID:39, civicEID:6099.
